# Types of Data Structures:

## Queues

### First In First Out (FIFO)

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

## Stacks

### First in, Last out (FILO)

A stack is similar to an array with one significant difference: elements are only accessible from one end, the top. This means we canâ€™t randomly access elements. We can add elements to the stack and we can remove elements from the stack. But if we want to access an element mid-way in the stack, you guessed it, we need to pop the elements above it off the stack.

The classic analogies for the stack data structure are plates or cafeteria trays. In a cafeteria, when you line up to be served, you take a tray off the top of a stack of trays. You take one tray and only one tray. When dirty trays are washed they are put on top of the stack.

## Sets

### The "Set" object lets you store unique values of any type, whether primitive values or object references. A value in the Set may only occur once; it is unique in the Set's collection.

Set objects are collections of values. You can iterate through the elements of a set in insertion order. The insertion order corresponds to the order in which each element was inserted into the set by the add() method successfully (that is, there wasn't an identical element already in the set when add() was called).
